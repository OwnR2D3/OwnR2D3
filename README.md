- 👋 Hi, I’m @OwnR2D3 or properly known as Roger Dissmore III
- 👀 I’m interested in music, IT, Audio and Video Production, everything Apple, and most recently, coding for website and app development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to develop using the MERN stack for apps and websites.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a couple of different apps I have wanted to create in the past, but I had no knowledge or the "know-how" to get started.
- 📫 How to reach me: Roger.Dissmore@GMAIL.com / https://www.linkedin.com/in/roger-dissmore-iii-6a639a125/ /
